            <br /> 
            <h2 class="">1. Flexible Time but Fixed Attendees</h2>
            	<br />
            	<p class="muted">Typically dinner out with old friends or a double-date, these events are a matter of coordinating everyone's schedule to find that time that works. <b>Find BestTime</b> automates this process and serves up the next times that work for everyone. A major time saver.</p>
        	<h2 class="">2. Fixed Time but Flexible Attendees</h2>
        	<br />
        	<p class="muted">When you have some open free time in the near future and want to quickly find out who is also free. With the list of possible attendees you can then pick who to plan an event with. <b>Who Is Free</b> removes the huge barrier to accessing this information. Having to send a mass text message only to hear back that most people have plans is a dreaded process. Removing this step will have more people taking the initiative to schedule social events.</p>
        	<h2 class="">3. Wide Open</h2>
            	<br />
            	<p class="muted">It's the most difficult event to plan. On a wide-open weekend when the pressure is on to have an epic time, it's a lot of work to find the event or activity, then find people who are available and free. <b>My BestTime</b> does all the work for you and serves up social events pairing you with other friends who are free and great events and activities in the area. Pick from the list of potential events to make sure you are spending your time on the best time possible.</p>
